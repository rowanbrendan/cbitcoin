Information:
        BRBitcoin is a client that provides a portion of the bitcoin protocol
    for the UMD bitcoin network.  Fully-supported commands include version,
    verack, ping, pong, addr, and getaddr.  Partially-supported commands
    include getblocks, inv, getdata, and block (as these commands are
    implemented one-way rather than two-way; for instance, my client will
    issue getblocks commands, but doesn't respond to them as a normal client
    would).
        Version exchange, ping-pong every minute, an interactive interface,
    multiple connections, and connection bookkeeping are features of this
    client.  Blocks can be downloaded through the various protocol messages,
    but this feature is not guaranteed to be 100% correct.  Mining and DHT
    was not implemented.

BRBitcoin usage:
    ./bin/BRBitcoin block_chain_directory

    Run the bitcoin client with a given block chain directory that will be
